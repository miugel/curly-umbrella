## Modern Realtor Coding Assessment

### Instructions
1. To demo locally, clone the project and run `cd client && npm install && npm start`.
2. Open `localhost:3000`.

Also, deployed here: https://modernrealtor.vercel.app/.

### Improvements
Due to limited time, I kept use cases simple. Given more time, I would focus on the following:
- Add Typescript to the project for strict types -> better dev experience, along with form validation
- Implement better designs and polish type form experience
- Lots of extractions to be made (reusable components and utilities)
- Create server, currently app is client-side only
